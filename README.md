Infinitely differentiable Data-driven model for high temperature Equilibrium Air

IDEA is an open-source library supporting infinitely differentiable ANN-based models designed to predict thermodynamic and transport properties of 11-species (N2, O2, N, O, NO, NO+, N+, O+, N++, O++, e-) equilibrium air at high temperature (up to 25000 K).
